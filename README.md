## Introduction
Hello, in this project I have created an application that will be useful to most people nowadays. This is an application for recording your to-do's, plans, everything you have to do and cannot be forgotten. Simple intuitive interface, minimalist design, just what you need. I used mostly TypeScript and React here. Read about all the technologies used below. Enjoy my new project!

## How to use the app
* Register your email when you first use the site.
  * All work will continue on the site that opens.
* Enter in the input field what you need to do
* After your task is completed, click on the circle to the left of the task to mark it as completed.
* To remove a task from the list, click on the cross to the right of the desired task
* To the left of the input field, there is a button that will mark all tasks as completed

**Below all tasks is a panel where you can:**
- see the number of your tasks
- sort tasks into completed and active
- delete all completed tasks
